<p>First announced by GitHub on 29 June 2021, GitHub Copilot is an artificial intelligence tool developed by GitHub and OpenAI to assist users of Visual Studio Code.In simple it is a vs code extension by which you can convert your comments into code. GitHub Copilot understands significantly more context than most code assistants. So, whether it’s in a docstring, comment, function name, or the code itself, GitHub Copilot uses the context you’ve provided and synthesizes code to match. A tool powered by gpt3 capable of writing code automatically all you have to do is write a descriptive function name or some comments and it will automatically fill in the implementation details for you and it's not just inserting a snippet this is actual novel code that has never been seen before.</p>
